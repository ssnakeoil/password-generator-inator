# Welcome to the Password Generator-inator!

This application uses javascript to generate a randomized password based on the user's responses to a series of prompts. Upon clicking "Generate Password" user will be presented with prompts for desired characters. At least one character type must be selected, or user will recieve an error and will have to go through prompt series again. As well, length must be a number between 8-128, if input does not fit these conditions, error will show and user will need to start prompt series from the beginning.
